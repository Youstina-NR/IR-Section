#File Positions
#The tell() method tells you the current position within the file;
#in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes
#from the beginning of the file.

#The seek(offset[, from]) method changes the current file position.
#The offset argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved.
#The from argument specifies the reference position from where
#the bytes are to be moved.
#The position is computed from adding offset to a reference point;
#the reference point is selected by the from_what argument.
# 0 (default)measures from the beginning of the file,
# 1 uses the current file position,
# 2 uses the end of the file as the reference point.
